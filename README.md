# R_Loan_Status

Detailed model building was carried out on a selection of Bank Loan clients with the main goal of improving decision making when classifying the credit standing of future customers. 

The bank’s current customer data was used to train various models in R Studio, with the pruned decision tree model being the most accurate at predicting whether a client’s credit standing would be Good or Bad. 

This model was then deployed and used on a selection of new loan clients in order to classify their potential creditworthiness.
